# mini-ESR
toy example of collaboratively putting together an Ecosystem Status Report

## Best practices: 
1. Start a new branch for features; in our case a new indicator
2. In that branch, you should only update that indicator
3. Collaborators should not work on the same branch at the same time to avoid overlapping code or conflicts
4. When the indicator is ready to be added, the team member responsible for it should submit a pull request
5. The request has to be approved by the repo admin before it is merged and the branch is deleted.
6. Do this for all the indicators; there can be many branches and merging should be straightforward if the new code is only for that indicator and is not working on other dependencies within the repo
