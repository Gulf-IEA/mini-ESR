## How is GOM IEA using Openscapes?

<br/>
<br/>

. . .

**Problem:** Ecosystem Status Reports are complex and difficult to update

<br/>

. . .

**Solution:** Use the Openscapes mindset and tools to build more collaborative, streamlined, and easily updated ESRs

## How ESRs are currently made...

<br/>

::: {.incremental}
- **Data:** numerous sources, CSVs everywhere
- **Metadata:** each researcher's responsibility
- **Analysis:** excel and R
- **Version control:** Final_Final_REALLY FINAL.pdf
- **Storage:** individual computers, google drive
- **Communication:** periodic meetings and emails
- **Writing:** Google docs, RMarkdown sometimes

## How we want to improve...

<br/>

::: {.incremental}
- **Data:** structured, relational databases
- **Metadata:** uniform format, stored on github
- **Analysis:** scripts stored in one github repo
- **Version control:** Pushes to github from R
- **Storage:** document on Github where data are
- **Communication:** meetings, issues on Github
- **Writing:** Live Quarto document
