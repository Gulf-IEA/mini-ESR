# GitHub

::: notes
-   Today we will be covering GitHub and Quarto to demonstrate how these tools can be used to enhance your workflow with collaboration and reproducibility in mind.

-   Question: Who has used or has some experience with GitHub and/or Quarto/RMarkdown?

-   Disclaimer: I'm going to go through some of the parts of GitHub and Quarto. It may be overwhelming but I want you to realize what tools are out there that we can utilize.

-   The goal of this presentation is to just make everyone aware of these tools, what they can do, and act as a jumping off point to your own research.

## What is GitHub?

::: {style="text-align:center"}
</br>

**Git** is software that does file versions and bookkeeping.

## How is GitHub Organized?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Users:** Each person makes their own GitHub account

-   NOAA naming convention is FirstLast-NOAA (i.e. BrittanyTroast-NOAA)

![](Quarto%20Example%20Pres_files/GitHub_personal.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
**Organizations:** Individual accounts can be added to organizations for collaborative projects

-   Acts like a personal account that some or all members can control (can alter permissions)

## How is GitHub organized?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Repos (Repositories)**

-   Folders that contain files like data, code, reports, images, formatting files, read me etc.

-   Can be in a personal account or in an organization's account

## GitHub: Projects

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Customize lists
-   Assign tasks to people
-   Add due dates
-   Link issue threads
-   Categorize with milestones
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](Quarto%20Example%20Pres_files/GitHub_project.png){fig-align="center" width="850"}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   To Do, In Progress, Finished

-   Short term, Long term, Complete
:::

## GitHub: Issues (Discussion Thread)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](Quarto%20Example%20Pres_files/GitHub_issuelist.png){.absolute left="0" width="450"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Any member can create a new issue
-   Issues can be searched and categorized
-   Can close issues once a resolution is reached
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Creates historical account of past issues and solutions which can be referenced moving forward

-   Allows for easier reproducibility for searching past issues without reinventing the wheel
:::

## GitHub: Issues (Discussion Thread)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](Quarto%20Example%20Pres_files/GitHub_issues.png){width="630"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Can tag/assign to people within the thread

-   Timeline of actions included in thread

-   Notifications go to those tagged or whoever has notifications on

-   Can add to projects
:::
:::

::: notes
-   Set your notification preferences by email & frequency, different threads per project
-   Will alleviate long email threads
-   Allows certain people to be working on a part of the project without pulling everyone in but still allowing others to see and track the progress
-   All very interconnected
:::

## Publishing Platform

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Publish Websites

-   Use templates to quickly make websites hosted by GitHub

![](Quarto%20Example%20Pres_files/GitHub_Website.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
Automatically update reports/websites for up-to-date results

::: notes
-   Can even add some of these GitHub features into these bulletins (i.e. report an issue link at bottom)
-   During our discussions yesterday we mentioned how we need better products that are more likely to be used by end users
-   Websites were identified as more useful and this could be a good compromise

## How is GitHub organized?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Commits**

-   Commits are how someone edits or changes the files in the repo

-   Each new commit is tracked so that previous versions can be accessed

# Quarto

## What is Quarto?

::: {style="text-align: center"}
**Quarto** is a file format (.qmd) that is the next evolution to R Markdown files.

Allows you to create, convert, and publish **documents**, **presentations**, **websites**, **books** and more.

![](Quarto%20Example%20Pres_files/Quarto_NewDoc.png){fig-align="center" width="450"}
:::

## How does Quarto work?

::: {style="text-align: center"}
Allows you to switch between **Source** and Visual view while creating

## Enhances Reproducibility & Collaboration

<div>

-   Update reports/documents/presentations by rerunning code with new data or automating data retrieval

-   Host newest versions of reports on GitHub immediately with same link so always receiving updated version

-   Built in version control

-   Organization members can submit edits easily in GitHub and can be reviewed by other members

</div>

## Examples

-   Formats are not only useful for final products (websites, papers, etc.) but also for sharing code and results while working through a project

    </div>
    :::

::: notes
-   Updating a google doc with new results, figures, code everytime I updated would be time consuming

-   Because this is created within R Studio and works seamlessly with code I can just update the code within the file, rerun it and push it to the GitHub and tell people to check the link

-   Also offers a more organized format for both those familiar and unfamiliar with code etc.

If you are already using these tools (or similar) what do you find works best and would be most useful to the work we are doing?

How do we organize our workflow to make it more cohesive across groups and projects?
:::

::: notes
-   How do we make acquiring data easier?

-   How do you make processing data easier?

How can we make our meetings more efficient?
:::

::: notes
-   After certain milestones are achieved or previous meetings action items are completed?

    -   Discuss smaller tasks through GitHub Issues tracker to avoid chain emails and speed up process without having to call larger meeting while still having full group involved.

-   Standing meetings vs. as needed meetings?

    -   Call a meeting once tasks are marked completed in GitHub to move on to next major milestone

-   Standing working meetings

    -   Start the meeting with updates/new tasks

    -   Spend time working on tasks in the call semi-independently

    -   End call with updates, new action items etc.
